When using the sample .json file:


"_sample_name_" should be replaced with whatever you would like to name the env variable

"_directory_of_imported_package_" should be replaced with whatever directory leads to the top folder of the plugin (just before the packages folder)

NO OTHER CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE TO THE FILE (keep all punctuation, quotation marks, spaces, enters, etc. Json files are VERY SENSITIVE)
